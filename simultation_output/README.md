# Note:
The simulation output files are attached in this folder, which show the following
1. Receiver.JPG: Shows the sampling of the received signal, 16 times in each clock cycle to get the final value (based upon total high and low counts). The main clock for this block runs at the baud rate.
2. Timing.JPG: This shows the clock generation by the division of the main clock.
3. Transmit.JPG: Shows the stored data being transmitted at the negative edge of the baud rate clock.
4. UART.JPG: Basic block diagram of the UART module.
5. interrup.JPG: Shows the interrupt being generated by the receiver and hence the same sample of data being resend. Moreover, this does not compromise with the rest of the data as the next sample is transmitted in the immediate cycle.
